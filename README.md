General Algorithm
--
1. The service manages a list of arrests for each client
2. Arrests are associated with clients. Client uniqueness is determined by the attributes: last name, first name, ID type, ID number-series
3. Before searching for a client, it's necessary to validate the ID number-series format
4. If a client is not found in the system, they should be created
5. Before creating an arrest object, data correctness should be verified: document number format, ID format, and other aspects
6. Specifics of arrest operations
   - Initial arrest - an arrest object is created, linked to a client, and its status is set to "Active"
   - Modification of an arrest - the system searches for the arrest, and its fields (amount, basis) are updated. If the arrest amount is greater than 0, the status is set to "Active"; otherwise, it's set to "Canceled"
   - Cancellation of an arrest - the system searches for the arrest, and the internal arrest status is set to "Canceled"
